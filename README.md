# Swarm Issuance App

Frontend app for SRC20 tokens issuance. Allows token issuers to create tokens, deploy on Ethereum and manage during their whole life cycle, including rising funds. Investors, on the other hand, can list the fundraisers, contribute and manage their SRC20 tokens in a wallet.

Built by the Swarm Community and for the Swarm Community with Next.js / React / ethers.js / ant.design. 

Works as an reference interface for [Swarm Contract Suite](https://https://github.com/my-swarm/contracts), uses [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/) [Subgraph](https://https://github.com/my-swarm/subgraph) to query blockchain data.
